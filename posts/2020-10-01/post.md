# a blog

If you're reading this, the blog server is running and successfully hosted!. New blog posts can be added to blog/posts with an accompanying JSON file of the same name containing metadata like post date. 

Posts consist of a directory added to ./posts, which contain an .md file with text, as well as any additional resources (such as images). [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax is supported, which allows for quick formatting.

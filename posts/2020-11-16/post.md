# Bites and Bits
### Your obligatory non-cynical, non-political post for the month

I recently got an ad for a multivitamin aimed at vegetarians. The concept seems sound: vegetarians like myself [have a harder time coming by certain nutrients like the B vitamins](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446). God knows how many times someone has asked me where in the heck I get my protein from without meat. Until now, I've always just shrugged. I've been entirely meat-free for over 16 years and I've never had trouble running, biking, or climbing. I haven't dropped dead, so surely I'm doing *alright*! When I started looking into multivitamins, however, I found a distinct lack of studies correlating them with wellbeing or even lowered morality. Unless you're seriously deficient, most studies conclude that multivitamins are, at best, harmless. The Mayo Clinic agrees, [stating that whole foods are usually a better source of nutrients than multivitamins](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/multivitamins-and-supplements-to-take-or-not-to-take/), and appear to be absorbed more efficiently and yield additional benefits.

This all begs the question... are we eating the right stuff? Coincidentally, my flatmate recently ordered a digital scale and I have no shortage of time, so I've resolved to log everything I eat or drink into a nutrient tracking app for the next week to get a clearer picture. The easy method is to log foods in bulk; entries in most nutritional databases exist for meals like "greek salad" or "pesto pasta". We can go even more granular than however. For anything unbranded like vegetables, the option exists to log ingredients down to the gram. It takes awhile to weigh everything as you cook, but hey, it's better than [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) on Twitter.

Anyway, check back in a week for some (surely) exciting results!

### Mystery Music

In unrelated news, I stumbled upon [a new artist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ZzXaAuivVXuQaHCaRuxlD?si=ACmMUE-EQOqPCYru0mFWvg) that I really liked. When I checked the name, all I was presented with was this:

`00110100 01010100`

Hmm. Who could it be? You probably knew this, but it appears to be binary! Let's convert it...
`0    0    1    1    0    1    0    0         0    1    0    1    0    1    0    0 `
`2⁷   2⁶    2⁵   2⁴   2³   2²   2¹   2⁰        2⁷   2⁶    2⁵   2⁴   2³   2²   2¹   2⁰`
`0 +  0 +  32 + 16 + 0 +  4 +  0 +  0         0 + 64 +  0  + 16 + 0 +  4 +  0 +  0 `
`                  52                                          84               `

Taking a *wild* guess, this is probably encoded with ASCII, the simplest possible text encoding. Let me just consult my table for these two numbers, and we get...
`4 T`
Ah. I should have known from the wild percussion. It's the well known trip-hop artist [Four Tet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tet)! For anyone listening along at home, my favorite bit is the end of track number five (0181 0005), and the transition into track number six (0181 0006). This isn't really a "secret" album, it's listed on [his Discogs entry](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3543-Four-Tet). Still, I thought it was a fun puzzle. For further incognito entertainment, check out Four Tet's [Wing Dings](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1TIbqr0x8HoKzKBNtNN8wf?si=mU8FoicbR32Etr4NjhmBTw) album :)

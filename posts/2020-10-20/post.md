# Việt Nam: A retrospective

I visited Vietnam in May of 2019 for an all-too-brief two weeks. This following is a smattering of notes I took in hostels, trains, and planes on my voyage.

### Sunday, May 5th
The first day is... not ideal so far.  The morning of initially went smoothly; I arrived at MSP on time, didn't forget anything, and I was feeling calm and collected. That is until I went up to get my boarding pass for LAX. The attendant casually informed that I had missed the flight. Oops. In my all my careful spreadsheeting of dates and times, I had mistakenly swapped the arrival and departure times!

In the end, I was able to find a flight to LAX in time to catch the connection to Guangzhou and avoided salvaging an entirely new itinerary. A single Delta flight fit the bill, and at just the right time too! Still, it was a $418 mistake. Not how I had hoped to start this trip.

The Delta flight and layover at LAX go without a hitch. It still didn't feel real, even as I sat in California watching the heat ripple off the pavement. The next flight crosses the Pacific and should plunk me down in Asia. Am I really about to fly across the Pacific? To *China*? In my head, Asia is still an abstract idea.

### Monday, May 6th
I guess it is technically tomorrow. My internal clock is entirely amiss. I was not able to sleep much on the rest of the 14 hour flight to Guangzhou, but thankfully the international transfer process was so easy an illiterate and sleepy foreigner could do it without much hassle. The airport was clean with a pleasant abundance of real, live plants. This even an included a entire wall of bromelids and ferns. I was able to (wordlessly) order a meal of fried okra and beer (I was not a fan of this okra).

I’m typing this on the final leg of the flight onboard a smaller Southern China airbus to Hanoi, where I’ll arrive at midnight local time. I told myself I'd have planned out some smaller details by this point (such as reaching the hostel from the airport), but I still don’t have a real plan. My itinerary just had a single word in that spot: "taxi". At this point, without a SIM card, it seems my only option is to withdraw cash wherever I can and hope the taxis idling out front don't rip me off too hard. I *probably* could have planned this a little better. Tuesday should be more telling and set the tone of the trip proper. Very much looking forward to a bed where I can sleep, horizontally, like a human being and not whatever airplane designers think people are.

### Tuesday, May 7th
Even in the early morning hours I was able to buy a SIM card in the very quiet Nội Bài International Airport. The modern way to get a ride in Vietnam is apparantly an app called Grab, like our version of Uber or Lyft. A few clicks get you a ride on your choice of car or motorbike (more on that later). A short ride later, and I was plunked in front of my destination. The hostel was clean and air conditioned. A blessing. I tossed my bag on the bunk and fell asleep on top of it. In the morning I took a shower, and feeling like a human again, decided to take a walk around the legendary [Hoàn Kiếm lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C3%A0n_Ki%E1%BA%BFm_Lake). 

Getting there was hairy. the traffic here has no western comparison. At least in the old quarter, there are no center lines, dividers, or rules. Driving on the right side of the street is a suggestion. Driving on the street at all is a suggestion. The sidewalk works just as well, after all. Despite the apparent chaos accidents seem relatively rare. My first encounter with Hanoian traffic was startling, but went smoothly. The strategy is something like this: pick a relatively quiet time to cross, say a prayer, and just start walking. The locals will weave around you.

Everywhere there are tiny shops offering noodle dishes. Much of it is prepared right off the side of the street. There’s a good number of wild, exotic trees on the street and especially surrounding the lake. Their gnarled bark splits off into branches that merge back into the trunk, and large fruit hangs from many of them. I can't name any of them.

![epiphitic tree](./posts/2020-10-20/epiphytes.png)
*Epiphytes cover the trunk of a tree in Bach Thao Park.*

I continued on to West Lake (Hồ Tây), stopping  at the Hanoi Bontanical garden on the way. Admittance was a cool eight cents (2,000₫). It was a welcome break from the cacophony of the street. Inside were many palms and a carpet of thick grass. Most enticingly there were also very few other people. There were also a few sad looking peacocks and macaques (con khỉ). I also managed to scammed on the way and paid $8 for a few slices of fried banana bread, which was more than my 22km taxi ride to the Hostel. I wasn't yet adjusted to the hustle and noise, so I decided to take a Grab bike back instead of walking. A biker in a green Grab jacket pulls up, hands you a helmet, you get on the back, and then you're off! This did not feel very safe, but it was very fun. Plus, it only cost 22k₫, which was less than a dollar. 

After lunch I settled into the hostel commons for awhile. The man working the front desk asked if I was going on the walking tour, and having no planned alternative yet, I said yes. I chatted with my the first fellow tourist (Brianna) to arrive as people trickled in. The tour was alright, stopping first at a Buddhist temple and then at narrow alleyway full of food vendors. I ordered some spring rolls in Vietnamese (or, more likely, my finger gesturing was sufficient) and my tour group disappeared down the alley. The street vendor was insistent I sit down, so I obliged. When I caught up in the trinket market Brianna, pulled me aside. “Want to ditch?”, She asked, and I agreed. Brianna had accrued a solid list of food to try and sights to see and we set about tasting fresh beer and mango shakes. After a plate of Phở Chiền Phống (fried Phở) we stopped back at the hostel and met a few new friends.

From there we departed to ‘Train Street’, a narrow alleyway with train tracks leaving a spare foot on each side. We enjoyed Bia Hanoi and waited for the train to come. When it did, a loud honk startled us out of our tipsy conversation and rattled the buildings as it went by. We stopped for a butter pastry on the way back to the hostel and a hard earned nights’ sleep.

![train alley](./posts/2020-10-20/train_street.png)
*It's no joke. When the train comes, there's less than two feet of clearance on either side.*

### Wednesday, May 8
I woke early and headed downstairs for a free breakfast and to plan out what I was doing next. I had decided after talking with some hostel mates the night before that [Ninh Bình](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninh_B%C3%ACnh_Province) was next on the docket. Ninh Bình is a smaller and more rural province south of Hanoi. I booked a hostel outside of the city of Ninh Binh and a train ticket to get there. I decided to kill some time around Hoàn Kiếm lake and got to try the famed coffee and condensed milk (Cá Phê Sữa) on the way. Shortly after arriving at the lake, a woman ran after me and begged for help -- first I thought she might be a scammer, but she just wanted homework help! It turns out English fluency is a hot commodity here. After only a year of study, she was already nearly fluent. Conjugation is a tough topic because the Vietnamese language does not do much of it. I tried to explain how prepositions work (turns out she knew more than I did), and in return she helped me a little with my Vietnamese pronunciation. A lost cause, unfortunately. When I told her I had accidentally spent $8 on a fried banana the day before she didn’t believe me at first. She informed me I could have purchased *one hundred bananas* for that price. First, she brought me to a local supermarket and told me to only buy from similar places. Then she gave me some good advice: always refuse the street vendors. We said goodbye and I took a Grab bike to the station and found my train without issue.

### Thursday, May 9
I ended up next to a Vinh local (Quang) on his way back to university. He spoke a little English, but we conversed mostly through Google Translate. When a trolley came around with snacks, I tried to buy a bag of what I thought were plums with a large note (500,000₫, $21), which is all the ATMs dispense. The woman working the trolley cart shook her head no. I was embarrassed and motioned to return the snacks, but paid for me. We chatted a little more. He asked if I know what Buddhism was, and I tried to explain I knew *of* it, but not much *about* it. Google struggles with Vietnamese a lot, in no small part to the tendency of the Vietnamese to omit diacritics while typing. That can't be an easy mapping for Google to make with a tonal language! He eventually reached into his bag and handed me a necklace of prayer beads and insisted I keep them. He demonstrated how to slowly count the beads to cultivate calmness. Eventually we rolled into Ninh Bình, we said goodbye, and he watched me through the window as the train lurched forward once again.

Right away I was besieged by taxi operators offering to take me places. Remembering my lesson on street venders earlier, I turned them all down (multiple times). For the most part this works, but in this case one persistent man followed me outside. Despite my better judgements, I relented and asked what his prices were. He offered a motorbike rental for “today, tomorrow, and second tomorrow” for a 2,000,000₫ ($86). A great deal, he claimed. In the end he was right; it was a better price than my hostel was offering. He let me take it around the block, showed me how to operate the lights, and where the gas tank was. When I explained my destination his face lit up. He told me he lived that way and I could follow him halfway there! 

Now, if this sounds like a terrible idea to you, then you have better instincts that I do. I certainly could have crashed (I had never ridden a motorbike before), gotten robbed, or found myself on the wrong end of the law for driving without a license. Regardless, motorbikes are **the** way to get around Vietnam.

Suddenly, I was following a stranger through the bustling Ninh Bình traffic. We arrived at a city gate where he left me with the vague instructions to go forward and eventually turn right. It was now raining, heavily. Thankfully it was a warm tropical drizzle and not something more serious. I mapped it on my dying phone and ended up on a dirt road in the jungle. Wrong — a river separated me and the hostel. I took a few guesses and eventually found my destination, which turned out to be a very pleasant hostel in the countryside.

I conversed and played pool with two fellow solo travelers named Florian and Nikolas from France and Switzerland respectively. After a decent meal of fried tofu I fell asleep in the hot and humid bunk room.

### Friday, May 10th
It is 4:30am and the entire jungle is awake. The roosters started half an hour before. The dogs next door are fighting. It is already 72° and 97% humidity. I give up on sleep and go for an early shower, which I shared with an enourmous banana slug.

I kill some time and watch the neighborhood wake up. A tiny cat yowls at me. A few hours later Nico awakes and we get breakfast. We make a rough plan to stock up in Ninh Binh (I don’t need anything but motorbike practice) and head off. The riding is easy, but Ninh Binh is relatively dirty. At least it’s calmer than Hanoi. After Nico finds a pillow and notebook (and I find some bandages for my blistered feet) we continue on to Hang Múa, taking a leisurely route though the rice fields. Hang Múa is a little expensive and touristy, but very picturesque. Our version of exploring this area involved climbing a small karst montain. At the top, there are incredible views of Vietnam's signature topography and the status of a slender dragon snaking across the peak. Beside the dragon is a small Buddhist shrine. Almost everyone there is a tourist, but at least one visitor pays respects.

![top of hang mua](./posts/2020-10-20/karst.png)

We take another long route back through a stone carving district where endless rows of warehouses are staffed by the locals wielding angle grinders against the soft grey of local karst rock. They sculpt the stone into cherubic lions, stately tomb markers and enormous ornate decorations. A fine white dust settles on my rear view mirrors. That night we drank Bia Hanoi and played pool, falling asleep at the now familiar 8:30pm. At least in the north, everything stops shortly after sunset.

The next day we take a leisurely breakfast before riding out to the main road. We exchange emails before parting ways. I went on to see the old capital of Ninh Binh, stopping to smell the flowers. A woman tries to sell me gas for an outrageous $8/liter. I'm more confident now and willing to backtrack into town to avoid getting ripped off again. I'm bold enough to call it out: Too expensive! Không! Quá đắt! Surprisingly, she seems amused, maybe even excited that I knew any Vietnamese at all. She offered me a fairer price and I accept. The ride back to Ninh Bính is easier than I expect and I sip on some juice while waiting for the train. Despite their antiquated exteriors, they seem to always arrive on time. Priorities, I guess.

On the train, my seat is next to an older Vietnamese woman who insists on teaching me some stretching exercises (Qidong?) while a few passengers chuckle at the sight. The trains in Vietnam are so social! Maybe I just stick out as a pale Minnesotan. She keeps handing me these strange purple fruits - plums? I later learned these "plums" were [purple star apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysophyllum_cainito). At first I ate the seeds (extremely bitter) and then she demonstrated how to eat it, spitting the seeds out and eating only the soft fleshy meat. It has a fine and delicate flavor, but the slimy texture disagrees with me. I thought it rude to decline, so I ate as much as I could. She shows me photos of plants and grandkids on an ancient Nokia phone. We wave goodbye she reaches her stop, and I am left with two dozen star apples.

In Hanoi I’m once again feeling tired and feeling overwhelmed. Even after living on one of the buisiest streets in Minneaplis for a year, the cacaphony of Hanoi is a lot to handle. I walk around awhile decide to splurge at a high end restaurant. The one I find is spectacular: It's tucked away and unassuming. Diners can sit on small islands in an indoor koi pond surrounded by live plant walls, entirely isolated from the bustle of Hanoi. I'm the only patron at 6pm on a Friday night.

### Saturday, May 11th
The next morning I book a bus to Cat Ba island east of Hanoi.

A man on a scooter leads me out to the street where me and another woman wait for almost half an hour for the bus to appear. It’s a long drive out into the country. I sit next to a Ukrainian woman who alternates between flirting and showing me photos of her wedding (last month). An interesting character. The next leg of trip requires a ferry. The bus ride is pretty comfortable, and it's a shock to leave the quiet cocoon of the bus.

The ferry dock is crazy. We get off the bus into the searing heat and are herded towards the boat. It’s dirty and smelly. After the ferry we get on a second bus, where I booked a room the nearest hostel. It happens to be called ‘Woodstock’. Interesting. I thought I had booked a *room* of some kind. Maybe even a ceiling. It turns out what I actually booked was a tent on the beach for some all-night festival. Marijuana and LSD are on sale at the front desk. Maybe not what I'm here for. I quicky booked an all-day tour for the next morning.

### Sunday, May 12th
The tour leaves at 8am. We’re taken to a dock where I was asked if I planned to be back by 4pm (that wwas the deal, wasn't it?). Turns out the itenerary is different than I thought. If I wanted to be on the 4pm bus to Hà Giang the next day (yes please), then I should have brought my luggage. Whoops. Ha Long bay is beautiful, but touristy. It’s also marred by trash in the ocean. We stop at a floating dock to kayak (lots of tourists) and and a beach to swim where I got do a little climbing. We stop last at is at "monkey island" where the monkeys are definitely more in charge of the food court than the attendants are. I watch a macaque chug a Coca Cola in one swing.

The bus ride to Hà Giang is a little uncomfortable. I develop a mild case of food poisioning, and the bus is bumpy and uncomfortable. It's a six hour drive. Night comes, and in some Hanoian suburb I'm ordered off the bus. The replacement/transfer bus is even worse, smelling of mildew, cigarettes, and incredibly humid. I spend most of this time queasy, feeling like I might die, and trying to decide whether or not to throw up. When we arrive I find out the city of Hà Giang is sprawling, and my hostel is tens of kilometers away. I'm not sure if my bus ticket has covered fair to the hostel, and it's now 3am. Two Australians greet me at the bus stop, presumably working for the hostel we're now standing in. They arrange for someone's brother to pick me up in a taxi. I can't remember if I paid him or not. I arrive at the hostel and a woman opens the door. At this point I'm entirely dead inside and once again sleep on top of my backpack.

### Addendum

*At this point I fell of the schedule of keeping a daily log. The following was written almost a year afterward.*

Hà Giang was *easily* the highlight of the trip. After suffering a little to get there, I found the scenery of this region was worth it. I remember bits and pieces... initially I fell in with a group leaving the hostel at the same time. A few Australians who were nice enough, but I eventually left for preference of solitude. The roads became steep and winding. Jungle coats the hills here, like a verdant blanket stitched together by massive, prehistoric ferns. I end up on a bike again, and it's a huge improvement over my first. The feeling of riding a semiautomatic bike through Vietnam is hard to capture.

![my new bike](./posts/2020-10-20/bike.jpg)
*The venerable Honda Blade*

The first day is cold and misty. I'm still with the Australians as we get higher and higher into the mountains. My cheap plastic poncho is not doing much against the cold and damp. My glasses are totally obscured by rain and steam: Impossibly steep cliffs start cropping up. On a slick, mossy switchback one of the Australians wipes out. He asks me if I thought he was going too fast (you crashed, didn't you?). I hold my tongue and leave them behind after awhile.

I stop at a mountain tea house. Hot-chili squid flavored Lay's chips are for sale, but I go for tea instead. I hoped for a local tea, but a woman serves me a cup of Lipton. Sipping, I watch a cloud tear itself apart softly over the hills. The rest of the ride curves and gracefully weaves through the hills. It takes me past an incredible 50' tall carved stone monument to... socialism?

Some of those locals would give me strange looks, like I was an alien. Some were receptive, especially children. Some would run after you shouting whatever English they knew (HENLO!!). Women in richly colored dresses tended to fields. Even the kids work. I realize it more than ever then: I'm a white westerner who lives in the first world, with super markets and iPads and air conditioning. These people were subsistence farming. I'm an intruder. An interloper. I should't be here.

I continue on to Lung Cu -- the tip of the bike loop and officially my furthest point of 'exploration'. China is a stone's throw. From here, getting home means two days' motorcycle ride, an eight hour bus ride, 45 minutes in a taxi and two plane flights totaling 23 hours just to return to MSP. 

The Vietnamese here are not exactly on great terms with their northern Chinese neighbors. They haven't forgotten the 1979 Chinese invasion during the Sino-Vietnamese war, in which the Chinese retaliated against the Vietnamese for helping to topple the Khmer Rouge in neighboring Cambodia. I was told to stay off the border as it might still have land mines. Duly noted. In Lung Cu they've constructed a massive granite flag tower overlooking China. I climb to the top. Two young army officers are working on replacing the massive one-starred Vietnamese flag with an even larger one.

I ride on, past cinderblock houses with chickens in front; past a moonscape of twisted black igneous rock and neon green algae; past a valley entirely planted with corn, where the local houses are shaded by the tall stalks. I see the China border, supposedly containing uncleared mines left from the [Sino-Vietnamese war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War) in 1979.

![china border](./posts/2020-10-20/border.jpg)
*Vietnam won this war only a decade after besting the United States, and only a few years after defeating the bloodthirsty dictatorship of the Khmer Rouge.*

I stop for gas and water at strangely western road stop. The shop is set up very professionally, but a team of six close friends or family are manning it. They're playing karaoke. I'm the only person there. They offer me rice wine, and demand I sing. I do my best, but it's a rough show.

![the jungle of ha giang](./posts/2020-10-20/jungle.png)
*20 kilometers south of the Chinese border*

The rest of the ride is uneventful. Knowing the trip is over was painful. On the bus back, I meet a (white, western) Cambodian journalist and a German who's been traveling for six months. They're both on the tail end of their trips and none of us make an effort to know each other. The driver switches on very loud house music. It's going to be a long ride. Incredibly, the German is already asleep. When she woke up, she explained that a prescription for sleeping pills is not required in Vietnam.

I'm grateful to be back among my many creature comforts, but sitting at a cubicle makes me wistful. Now in the grip of COVID-19 travel seems like a very remote possibility. I'm not sure why I wrote this all down; maybe as a way of venting frustration. It was a very privileged act. International travel for leisure is perhaps the pinnacle of wealthy privilege. I left for selfish reasons. There are no lessons here. Just observations.

Vietnam is hard to describe. It's somewhat easier with video. I'll leave the reader with a [small montage](https://vimeo.com/356092347) of my time there.
